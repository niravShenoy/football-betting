# Football Betting
Based on principles of probability, the odds of results of any football game are calculated based on real life statistics. The game is then simulated using randomization techniques, taking into consideration the likelihood of possible results between any 2 given teams. The user can place bets on each fixture and depending on the simulated results, win or lose the bet.
